### Todo List App for DCodeLab

## Scope
- Users have to login or signup to use todo app
- Create a todo list together with the due date
- Can change app language
- Can change system theme (light and dark mode)
- Can view profile
- Check complete todo list with animations and strikethrough
- Logout!

## Process
- I used Firebase for the user authentication and storing datas
- The whole app is built with swiftui
- I added AppStorage for localization
